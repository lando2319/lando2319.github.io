Week 6 marks the halfway point in the Web Development course at [The Starter League](http://www.starterleague.com/), at this point the direction of the education is starting to take shape. During weeks 1 and 2 we learned Ruby from the ground up, supplemented with the book [Chris Pines' Learning to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). This gave us the foundation of knowing basic Ruby, which is necessary in order to effectively create a Ruby on Rails application. Weeks 3 and 4 were spent manually creating routes, controllers, and view pages for our Ruby on Rails applications. Weeks 5 and 6 were spent working with database tables and practicing creating apps using the proper "[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)" methods.

This brings us to the end of week 6. In many ways this is where the second leg of the journey begins. At this point we are expected to be comfortable creating a CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Most web applications come down to these basic functionalities. From here the ability to create a web application like Twitter seems, at the very least, possible and, at most, doable. A tweet can be seen as an example of the Create function, a users' feed can be seen as an example of the Read function, and so forth. The remainder of the Web Development course will largely be spent applying our skills into our own app idea.

The initial experience of feeling overloaded with new concepts has shaped itself into feeling empowered with what those concepts can achieve.
