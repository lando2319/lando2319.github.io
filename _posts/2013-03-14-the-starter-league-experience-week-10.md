As far as the Starter League Experience goes, we are entering into the end of the program. This means preparing for Starter Night (formerly Demo Day), where we showcase our web applications that we have been working on for weeks now. For me this has been revealing of just how much more there is to learn.

At this point our education is largely determined by the needs of our Demo Day App. Class time has been devoted to AJAX/JQuery/Javascript and other topics that make our app more professional grade. Just the fact that we are getting to these topic shows just how much content we cover in 12 weeks.
