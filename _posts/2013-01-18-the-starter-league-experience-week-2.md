Here I am at the end of week two of my journey to learn Ruby on Rails at [The Starter League](http://www.starterleague.com/). At this point I have created several computer programs, one that repeats your name back to you in capital letters, one that randomly selects a daily ruby method for you to learn, even one that sings the song “99 bottle of beer on the wall” (I crashed my system a few times while making that one, those pesky infinity loops and all)

Theme for this week:

Tear down, rebuild, tear down, rebuild… After following along dutifully this week, it wasn’t until I sat down in front of a blank ruby file and tried to create a program truly from scratch that I realized that I need serious practice. In massage therapy we use to call it “table time,” … time sitting there getting stuck, getting errors, working through IF-Then statements, figuring out alternative ways to run the program, in other words ACTUALLY coding.

On that note allow me to finish this blog post in ruby.

{% highlight ruby lineanchors %}
if coding.push

returns programmer

else

returns status_quo

end

I == excited

Ok, undefined local variable, game on…
